To actually get the needed files, Rename "Xash3D Optimized1.PDF" to "Xash3D Optimized.001", "Xash3D Optimized2.PDF" to "Xash3D Optimized.002", "Xash3D Optimized3.PDF" to "Xash3D Optimized.003", "Xash3D Optimized4.PDF" to "Xash3D Optimized.004", and "Xash3D Optimized5.PDF" to "Xash3D Optimized1.005". Then install 7-Zip and open the .001 file with it. Then extract the contents.

to install it, Put the valve folder that is inside the Xash3D optimized folder into the directory that Xash3D Reads from.

To set it up, you need a copy of half-life. If you have a copy, put the sound, sprites, resource, scripts, models, maps, gfx, hew, levelshots, and events folder into the valve folder you downloaded from here.
